## OKRs
### Artur Badretdinov

---

My team tells me that we often drop the ball

---

I've heard the same from others

---

> OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse operations, lending purpose and unity to the entire organization. 

---

* Focus
* Alignment
* Tracking
* Stretch
* Reflection

---

* Goals - What
* Key results - How?
    * Key results - SMART

---

> “hard goals” drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific
 hard goals “produce a higher level of output” than vaguely worded ones.”

---

> how do you build engagement? A two-year Deloitte study found that no single factor has more impact than “clearly defined goals that are written down and shared freely. . . . Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction.” 

---

> “When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated.” An effective goal management system—an OKR system—links goals to a team’s broader mission. 

---

> When people came to me mid-quarter with requests to draft new data sheets, I felt I could say no without fear of repercussion. My OKRs backed me. They spelled out my priorities for all to see. 

---

> If you tell everybody to go to the center of Europe, and some start marching off to France, and some to Germany, and some to Italy, that’s no good—not if you want them all going to Switzerland. If the vectors point in different directions, they add up to zero. But if you get everybody pointing in the same direction, you maximize the results. 

---

> When Casey Powell smacked us between the eyes, we responded within two weeks. When we smacked Motorola between the eyes, they couldn’t move nearly so fast. A manager there told me, “I couldn’t get a plane ticket from Chicago to Arizona approved in the time you took to launch your campaign.” 

---

> You can tell people to clean up a mess, but should you be telling them which broom to use? 

---

> Measuring what matters begins with the question: What is most important for the next three (or six, or twelve) months? Successful organizations focus on the handful of initiatives that can make a real difference, deferring less urgent ones. 

---

> Leaders must get across the why as well as the what. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission. And the process can’t stop with unveiling top-line OKRs at a quarterly all-hands meeting. As LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner likes to say, “When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear it.” 

---

> As Steve Jobs understood, “Innovation means saying no to one thousand things.” In most cases, the ideal number of quarterly OKRs will range between three and five. It may be tempting to usher more objectives inside the velvet rope, but it’s generally a mistake. Too many objectives can blur our focus on what counts, or distract us into chasing the next shiny thing. At MyFitnessPal, the health and fitness app, “We were putting too much down,” says CEO Mike Lee. “There were too many things we were trying to get done, and then the prioritization wasn’t clear enough. So we decided to try to set fewer OKRs, and to make sure that the ones that really matter are the ones that we set.” 

---

> To meet our objective for teacher engagement, with its time-bound key result, we had to defer many other things. In my view, you can only do one big thing at a time really well, and so you better know what that one thing is. 

---

> “You’re not going to get the system just right the first time around. It’s not going to be perfect the second or third time, either. But don’t get discouraged. Persevere. You need to adapt it and make it your own.” Commitment feeds on itself. Stay the course with OKRs, as I know firsthand, and you will reap amazing benefits.
